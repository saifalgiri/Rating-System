Assignment 2: 

We assume you are familiar with popular Review Portal ​TripAdvisor​ that most travellers(and locals) use to understand more about Hotels,
Flights, Local Attractions, Rentals etc.
.One of the problem that exists around this is that a user has to read a lot of reviews to understand the type of trip or traveller type 
a Hotel is most suited for. For example, a specific hotel might be more suitable for a ‘Romantic Holiday’ 
than others and some hotels might be more popular with ‘Family travellers with Kids’ than others.  

Now if you were to come up with a solution that would parse through all  the review content and categorize them with Unique Labels
like ‘Couple friendly’ ,  ‘Popular with Family travelers’ , ‘Romantic’ etc. how would you go about it.
Assume you  have access to thousands of review content ​like this one​, available to you via an API  connection.
